I learned the basics of HTML and learned the elements like headers and footers and nav bars.

I learned about integration froms from the login and how important it is to have secure info storing and to have a secure wbsite through the https.

I learned how to link pages together and now i know what happens when you click a link on a site that takes you to a different site.

I learned how to put placeholders for future functionality so that i can continue to build on my design and implement new features as I learn how to and as i come up with them.

Learned how to use CSS a little. Not enough to make cool animations on my website like the one that showed the time of day.

I've learned how important it is to commit every change as you make them because I wasn't doing that and I got way behind and kept losing and messing up files and made my assingment late.
